Battle Pokemon
============
My Final Project is a very basic version of the battle system, it has 1 class Pokemon for creating a pokemon(Pokemon),
and then one class for creating attacks(Attack) to go with each pokemon. The Battle class is the main for the program in which you use either the battle method for small creatures, or your use battlelvl50s for the larger Pokemon.

To run the program run the Battle classs.



Battle:
Battle has 2 methods for fighting pokemon, both take 2 pokemon as arguments, the Attacker and Deffender. The first Pokemon in both classes is the player controlled. While the second one as the Computer controled. Battle also has a 2 player mode.

Pokemon:

Pokemon has a full list of requirements. Name, Type, Attack, SP Attack, Deffense, SP Defense, Speed, and Moves 1-4. 
as well as a get and set method for all that are used. The unused stats will be a later version.

Attack:
Attack is a class with 2 requrements. The Name of the Attack and the damage it does. First being a String and the damage being a int.

Both have a get, but no need for a set.
